title: What is Habitbot?
date: 2012-12-25

<a href="http://www.habitbot.com">Habitbot</a> is a simple, free tool that lets you set goals you want to accomplish on a regular, recurring basis, like going for a walk or practicing piano every day.</p>
<p>The goal is to help without getting in your way. So, it has a very small feature set and a very simple interface.</p>
<p>You type in goals in natural English, like: “Practice piano every day”. Habitbot will parse this and create a checkbox for you to check off every day.</p>
<p>It will keep track of how long you’ve consecutively completed a goal and display it as a “streak”. This is inspired by <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">Jerry Seinfeld’s “don’t break the chain”</a> technique.</p>
<p>Habitbot is based on the idea that lifestyle changes come from taking action on a consistent basis. Set goals that are good for yourself, stick to them, and you’ll have a better life. It won’t be the difference between night and day, but even just a few little things, adhered to over a period of time, can significantly improve your life.</p>
<p>Habitbot is free and uses your existing Twitter username so you don’t have to come up with yet another password to remember. If you want, you can <a href="http://www.habitbot.com">sign up now</a>.</p>
