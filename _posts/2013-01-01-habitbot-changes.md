<p>Happy New Year. Habitbot was made with the kind of goals people set for their New Years resolutions in mind. I hope you stick with what you set out on and that Habitbot helps you succeed.</p>
<p>Today I added a basic mechanism for revising past streaks in case you achieved a goal but just didn’t check it off on the date you did so. Existing users can <a href="http://www.habitbot.com/habits/streaks/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>I also broke up the interface into a few different views: one for the current items to do, another for editing streaks, and another for editing goals.</p>
<p>It simplifies the starting page when you sign in and makes things a little nicer, I think.</p>
<p>A mobile client is on the way! I can’t promise an ETA, but it’s definitely planned.</p>
