<ul><li>Goals entered with trailing punctuation on them will no longer trigger an “invalid formatting” error message and will instead be parsed if the rest of the goal is correctly formatted.</li>
<li>Added a modal dialog to edit goal descriptions. I’m not yet entirely sure how to handle editing changes to starting dates and frequencies, because they change the meaning of a streak, so for now I’m punting on the issue and just making only the description editable. I might revisit the issue in the near future.</li>
<li>Added a modal dialog to confirm before deletion.</li>
<li>Better handling of goals that occur on specific days of the month (such as “pay rent every first of the month”).</li>
</ul><p>I’d like to start working on mobile clients soon, but I can’t promise an ETA.</p>
