title: Recent Habitbot changes, 12/27/2012
date: 2012-12-27

<ul><li>Fixed handling of weekly goals so that they appear as a todo item for a week as seems reasonable.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where weekly by-day goals had the wrong due date and were showing up on the wrong days.</li>
<li>Added a link to <a href="http://habitbot.tumblr.com">this blog</a> on Tumblr on the navigation bar.</li>
<li>Spruced up the homepage a bit with a screenshot.</li>
<li>Goals with URLs in them that begin with http:// or www. should be turned into clickable links. So “Visit <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> every day” will give you a clickable link. “Visit google.com every day” will not.</li>
</ul>
